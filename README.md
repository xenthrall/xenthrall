# Xenthral

Welcome to **Xenthral**, a personal repository that serves as a collection of apps and projects I've built with Python and other technologies throughout my learning journey.

The main goal of this repository is twofold:
1. To document my yearly progress as a developer.
2. To provide open, practical examples for others who want to learn from real projects.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by **year-based folders**, each containing the projects I build during that specific year.

xenthral/
├── proyectos_2025/
│ ├── xenthrall-academy/
│ └── other-project/
├── proyectos_2026/
│ └── (future projects)
└── README.md

- `proyectos_2025/` contains all my projects created in 2025.
- When 2026 arrives, a new folder `proyectos_2026/` will be created for that year's projects, and so on.

Each project will include its own README file explaining how to run it, what technologies it uses, and what you can learn from it.

## 🤝 Contribution & Learning

All projects are open for anyone to explore, learn from, or contribute to.

If you're learning Python, building GUIs, working with databases, or just curious about how small apps are structured, feel free to browse the folders and read the documentation inside each one.

This repository is updated over time. You might find some projects in progress, experimental ideas, or even prototypes that evolve into more complete applications.
